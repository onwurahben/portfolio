# AI Growth & Ops Automation System  
### For SaaS Teams & Marketing Agencies

---

## What I Do

I design and implement **custom AI automation systems** that eliminate manual work across **content, lead handling, and internal operations** — so teams can move faster without hiring more people.

This is not a chatbot.  
It’s an **internal AI system built around your workflows**.

---

## Who This Is For

**Primary:**  
- SaaS founders (Seed → Series B)
- Lean product and growth teams

**Secondary:**  
- Marketing agencies managing content, leads, and clients at scale

If your team is:
- Repeating the same tasks every week  
- Drowning in content, leads, or internal requests  
- Spending too much time coordinating instead of executing  

This system is designed for you.

---

## The Core Problems I Solve

- Content creation is slow and inconsistent  
- Leads are handled manually or too late  
- Internal knowledge is scattered across tools  
- Ops work pulls founders and senior staff into the weeds  
- Hiring more people feels like the only solution  

AI can replace **processes**, not people — when implemented correctly.

## The System (What Gets Built)

Each engagement delivers a **tailored AI Growth & Ops Automation System**, typically including:

### 1. AI Content Engine
- Long-form → short-form content automation  
- Blog, email, social, or internal doc generation  
- Review and quality-control workflows  

### 2. Lead Intake & Qualification
- Automated lead capture  
- AI-based qualification and routing  
- CRM / Notion / Airtable integration  

### 3. Internal AI Assistant
- “Ask the company” knowledge agent  
- Slack or Notion-based interface  
- Context-aware answers from your docs, tools, and data  

### 4. Ops & Workflow Automation
- n8n / Make-based automations  
- Cross-tool workflows (Notion, Airtable, Slack, email, etc.)  
- Logging, alerts, and visibility into operations  

### 5. Advanced Extensions (When Useful)
- **Voice agents** (support, onboarding, lead intake, internal use)
- **Video systems** (AI-driven content, onboarding, walkthroughs)

> Modalities (text, voice, video) are chosen based on ROI — not hype.

## Outcomes You Can Expect

- Fewer manual hours spent on repetitive work  
- Faster content and lead execution  
- Cleaner internal processes  
- Reduced hiring pressure  
- Systems that scale as you grow  

The goal is **operational leverage**, not experimentation.

---

## Engagement & Pricing

**Typical Structure:**
- **One-time system build:** $3,000 – $6,000  
- **Optional ongoing support & optimization:** $1,000 – $2,500 / month  

Final pricing depends on scope, tools, and complexity.

---

## How It Works

1. **Discovery & Audit** – Understand workflows, bottlenecks, and goals  
2. **System Design** – Map the AI architecture around your business  
3. **Build & Integration** – Implement automations and agents  
4. **Testing & Iteration** – Ensure reliability and usefulness  
5. **Handover or Ongoing Support** – Your choice  

---

## Why This Approach Works

- Built around *your* workflows, not generic tools  
- Focused on business outcomes, not AI demos  
- Modular and extensible as your needs evolve  

AI should feel like an **internal operator**, not another app to manage.
